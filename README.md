A zsh plugin that surfaces outdated global packages at the start of a shell session and offers a one-keystroke `Y/n/s` upgrade. Rate-limited to once every four hours, skipped in SSH and scripts, and never blocks shell startup.

```
▲ 4 updates available

  Homebrew
    gh           2.60.0 → 2.62.0
    fd           10.1.0 → 10.2.0
  npm (global)
    pnpm         9.0.0  → 9.5.1
    claude-code  2.1.0  → 2.1.1

  Update all? [Y/n/s] ›
```

- **`Y`** (or Enter): run every upgrade in sequence, grouped by manager.
- **`n`** (or Esc): skip everything; no re-nag until the next interval.
- **`s`**: step through per-package `Y/n` across all managers.

Supports **Homebrew** (formulae and casks), **npm (global)**, **pnpm (global)**, **uv tools**, **RubyGems**, **cargo** (via [`cargo-update`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-update)), **mise**, and **gobin** (Go binaries under `$GOBIN` via `go version -m` + `go install`). Each manager is independently configurable as `all`, `off`, or an explicit allowlist.

### Why?

You already have `brew outdated`, `npm outdated -g`, `uv tool list --outdated`. Running them by hand is friction nobody keeps up with. A session-start nag catches updates at a moment you're at the keyboard and ready to decide, without becoming `topgrade` (which upgrades everything) or an auto-updater (which decides for you).

## Install

Pick whichever matches your setup.

### oh-my-zsh

Clone into the custom-plugins directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/madisonrickert/zsh-pkg-update-nag \
  "${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-pkg-update-nag"
```

Add `zsh-pkg-update-nag` to the `plugins=(...)` array in your `~/.zshrc`, then `exec zsh`.

### zinit

```zsh
# in ~/.zshrc
zinit light madisonrickert/zsh-pkg-update-nag
```

### antidote

```sh
# in ~/.zsh_plugins.txt
madisonrickert/zsh-pkg-update-nag
```

### zdot

[zdot](https://github.com/georgeharker/zdot) ships a built-in [`update-nag` module](https://github.com/georgeharker/zdot/tree/main/modules/update-nag) that wraps this plugin:

```zsh
# in your .zshrc, alongside other zdot_load_module calls
zdot_load_module update-nag
```

### Standalone (plain zsh)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/madisonrickert/zsh-pkg-update-nag ~/.zsh-pkg-update-nag
echo 'source ~/.zsh-pkg-update-nag/zsh-pkg-update-nag.plugin.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh
```

### Verify it worked

Open a fresh terminal. The scan runs in the background, so your prompt appears immediately. A dim `(checking…)` notice flashes while the scan is in flight, then results land in place (either the update prompt or `All packages up to date.`) before your next prompt.

Confirm detected managers and the computed config any time:

```sh
zsh-pkg-update-nag --check-env
```

Subsequent shells within the four-hour rate-limit window stay silent. Run `zsh-pkg-update-nag --now` to force a check on demand.

### Keeping the plugin updated

The plugin doesn't self-update. Your install path already has that covered:

- **oh-my-zsh**: `omz update` pulls every custom plugin under `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/`. For periodic auto-updates of OMZ and every plugin, see [Pilaton/OhMyZsh-full-autoupdate](https://github.com/Pilaton/OhMyZsh-full-autoupdate).
- **zinit**: `zinit update`.
- **antidote**: `antidote update`.
- **Standalone**: `git -C ~/.zsh-pkg-update-nag pull`.

## Configuration

All options are optional. Defaults are sensible.

Config file location: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zsh-pkg-update-nag/config.zsh` (override with `$ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_CONFIG`).

```zsh
# ~/.config/zsh-pkg-update-nag/config.zsh

# How often to check (hours). Default: 4.
zsh_pkg_update_nag_interval_hours=4

# Presentation at the session-start nag. Default: prompt.
#   prompt   — render the summary and offer the [Y/n/s] upgrade prompt.
#   reminder — render the summary and print a one-line instruction to upgrade
#              on demand; never prompt, never read the terminal.
zsh_pkg_update_nag_mode=prompt
# Command suggested by reminder mode. Default: "zsh-pkg-update-nag --now".
# Point it at whatever you use to run the upgrade interactively.
# zsh_pkg_update_nag_reminder_command="zsh-pkg-update-nag --now"

# Per-manager: "off", "all", or a zsh array / whitespace-separated list of
# package names to watch. Default shown.
zsh_pkg_update_nag_brew=all
zsh_pkg_update_nag_npm=all
zsh_pkg_update_nag_pnpm=all
zsh_pkg_update_nag_uv=all
zsh_pkg_update_nag_gem=off
zsh_pkg_update_nag_cargo=all
  zsh_pkg_update_nag_mise=all
  zsh_pkg_update_nag_gobin=all

# Example: watch only two npm globals.
# zsh_pkg_update_nag_npm=(typescript prettier)

# Let Homebrew run its own confirmation prompt during an upgrade. Default: on.
# Set to "off" to pass `--yes`. See "Homebrew's confirmation prompt" below.
zsh_pkg_update_nag_brew_ask=on

# Minimum release age in days (0 = off, the default). See the section below.
zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age=0
# zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age_npm=14   # per-manager override; wins over the global
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_DISABLE=1` | Disable the plugin entirely. |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_FORCE=1` | Ignore the rate-limit for this shell. |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_SSH=1` | Opt in under SSH (default: skipped). |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_BACKGROUND=0` | Run the scan synchronously at shell load (default: background). |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_DEBUG=1` | Append diagnostics to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/zsh-pkg-update-nag/debug.log`. |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` | Per-provider timeout in seconds (default `10`). |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_CONFIG` | Override config file path. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Used by the brew min-age GraphQL fast path when `gh` isn't available (5000 req/hr). |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_MIN_AGE_LOOKUP_PARALLELISM` | Concurrency for the brew min-age REST fallback (default `6`). Only applies when neither `gh` nor `$GITHUB_TOKEN` is set. |
| `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_MIN_AGE_LIST_TTL` | Seconds to cache a package's version list in resolve mode before refetching (default `86400`). Lower values pick up newly-aged releases sooner at the cost of more registry calls. |
| `NO_COLOR=1` | Disable color output (per the [NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org) spec). |

## Reminder mode

If the inline `[Y/n/s]` prompt at shell startup is more interruption than you
want, set `zsh_pkg_update_nag_mode=reminder`. Each session still lists what's
outdated, but instead of prompting it prints a one-line instruction and returns
control immediately:

```
▲ 2 updates available

  Homebrew
    gh           2.60.0 → 2.62.0
  npm (global)
    pnpm         9.0.0  → 9.5.1

  Run  zsh-pkg-update-nag --now  to upgrade.
```

Nothing is read from the terminal, so the notice never competes with what you're
typing. Running the suggested command (`zsh-pkg-update-nag --now`) always takes
the interactive prompt path, regardless of the mode. That's how you actually
apply the upgrades. Point `zsh_pkg_update_nag_reminder_command` at an alias or
wrapper function if you drive upgrades through something else.

## Homebrew's confirmation prompt

Homebrew defaults to ask-mode: `brew upgrade` prints the plan, and prompts for
confirmation whenever that plan includes dependencies, dependents, or packages
beyond the ones you named. Upgrades run one command per package, so left alone
that means answering `Y` at the nag prompt and then answering Homebrew again for
every package that pulls something else in. The other five managers are
non-interactive, so brew is the only one that does this.

If that's more confirmation than you want, opt out:

```zsh
# ~/.config/zsh-pkg-update-nag/config.zsh
zsh_pkg_update_nag_brew_ask=off
```

The plugin then passes `--yes`. The echoed command shows the flag, so what you
see is what ran:

```
→ brew upgrade --yes gh
```

**This is opt-in on purpose.** Those prompts aren't redundant with the nag
prompt — they're the only place dependent upgrades are surfaced, and the
summary above lists only the named packages. Accepting `gh 2.60.0 → 2.62.0` may
also rebuild packages that never appeared in the list, and with `off` that
happens unseen. `brew upgrade --dry-run <pkg>` shows the same plan on demand.

`zsh-pkg-update-nag --check-env` reports the current setting on the brew row.

One caveat with `off`: `--yes` landed alongside ask-mode, so a Homebrew old
enough to predate it will reject the flag. Leave the setting `on` there.

## Background mode

Scans run in a background subshell, so plugin load returns immediately and shell startup stays snappy.

- A dim `(checking for package updates in the background…)` notice appears at your first prompt while the scan is in flight.
- When the scan finishes, the update prompt or `All packages up to date.` lands in place before your next prompt.
- `--now` always runs synchronously, so progress output stays visible while you wait.
- If multiple shells open at once, only one runs the scan; the others pick up its result.

To run synchronously instead (mainly useful when debugging), set `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_BACKGROUND=0` before the plugin loads.

### powerlevel10k instant-prompt

If you use [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) with instant-prompt enabled, the plugin auto-adapts: the dim "(checking…)" notice is suppressed (cosmetic only), and the results display is deferred one prompt so it lands after p10k finalizes. No action needed.

## Minimum release age

Optional supply-chain safety net. When `zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age` is set to N > 0 days, an update is only surfaced once the new version has been published for at least N days. Fresh releases get a quarantine window during which yanked or compromised versions usually surface.

```zsh
# ~/.config/zsh-pkg-update-nag/config.zsh
zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age=7           # global baseline
zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age_npm=14      # stricter for npm
zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age_brew=0      # off for brew
```

Per-manager overrides (`zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age_<manager>`) win over the global, even when set to `0`. Leave a per-manager variable unset to inherit the global.

For **npm**, **pnpm**, **uv**, and **gem**, when the latest release is younger
than your `min_age` threshold the plugin does not hide the package. It offers the
newest stable version that is old enough instead (prereleases, yanked, and
unpublished versions are skipped), and the upgrade is pinned to that exact
version. If nothing newer than what you have is old enough, the row is hidden,
same as before. **brew** keeps the simpler behavior: a too-new latest is hidden
until it ages past the threshold.

One per-manager caveat: npm's `npm view` does not expose per-version deprecation,
so a deprecated-but-still-installable npm version can occasionally be offered.
pnpm (which reads the registry document directly) does skip deprecated versions.

### Prefer the upstream feature when one exists

If your package manager has minimum-release-age built in, use **that** for those packages. It acts at install time (so it also protects ad-hoc installs) and avoids the per-package lookup this plugin does.

| Manager | Native minimum-age support | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| brew | None (homebrew/core is human-curated) | Use this plugin's setting |
| npm | [`min-release-age`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/config#min-release-age) (npm 11+) | Prefer npm's; this plugin's setting is the fallback when you can't change `.npmrc` |
| pnpm | [`minimumReleaseAge`](https://pnpm.io/settings#minimumreleaseage) in `.npmrc` | Prefer pnpm's; this plugin's setting is the fallback |
| uv | [`--exclude-newer DATE`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--exclude-newer) (per-invocation) | This plugin's setting is easier for ongoing use |
| gem | None | Use this plugin's setting |
| cargo | [`--cooldown <duration>`](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update/blob/master/man/cargo-install-update.md) on `cargo install-update` (cargo-update ≥ 20.0.0) | This plugin forwards the configured threshold to `--cooldown` automatically. Nothing extra to set up. |

When npm/pnpm/uv/gem lack a native minimum-age setting (or you can't change their config), this plugin resolves to the newest allowed version rather than hiding the package entirely.

### Performance

Each outdated package needs one lookup the first time it's seen, and the result is cached so steady-state cost is near-zero. Gate-mode lookups (brew) cache immutable publish dates forever in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/zsh-pkg-update-nag/age_cache.tsv`; resolve-mode managers (npm/pnpm/uv/gem) cache each package's version list under `version_lists/` with a TTL (see below). Most users see high cache-hit rates after a day or two.

| Manager | Lookup source | Cold-cache cost |
|---|---|---|
| brew | `brew info --json=v2` (~1.2 s fixed) plus a single GitHub GraphQL query covering every package via `gh api graphql` or `curl` with `$GITHUB_TOKEN`. Falls back to per-package serial REST when neither is available. | ~3 s for any number of packages on the fast path; ~N seconds on the unauth REST fallback |
| npm | `npm view <pkg> --json` + `jq` (config-aware via the npm CLI) | ~350–650 ms (network) per package |
| pnpm | `https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>` via `curl` + `jq` | ~100–300 ms per package |
| uv | `https://pypi.org/pypi/<pkg>/json` via `curl` + `jq` | ~100–300 ms per package |
| gem | `https://rubygems.org/api/v1/versions/<pkg>.json` via `curl` + `jq` | ~100–300 ms per package |
| cargo | `cargo install-update --list --cooldown <Nd>` (no per-package call from this plugin) | Whatever cargo-update spends refreshing the registry index (roughly one sparse-index fetch per installed cargo binary), bounded by the provider timeout |

Real-world: cold cache, 35 outdated brew packages with `gh` authenticated → about 7 s total. Steady state with cache populated: ~3–4 s regardless of N. Background mode keeps that latency entirely off the startup path. Each provider call is wrapped by `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` (default 10 s) so a hung HTTP request can never extend the scan past that cap. If a single manager is too slow even in the background, set its per-manager override to `0` to disable the lookup for it.

Resolve mode (npm/pnpm/uv/gem) fetches each outdated package's full version list
once and caches it under `version_lists/` with a TTL
(`ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_MIN_AGE_LIST_TTL`, default 24h / 86400s), so steady-state
cost stays near zero within the TTL window. This is the same single registry call
the prior per-version lookup already made.

### GitHub auth (brew only)

The brew lookup hits the GitHub API. In order of preference:

1. **`gh` CLI installed and authenticated** (`gh auth login`): single batched GraphQL call per scan; 5000 req/hr quota. Strongly recommended if you're enabling brew min-age.
2. **`$GITHUB_TOKEN` set**: same GraphQL fast path via `curl`; same 5000 req/hr quota.
3. **No auth**: per-package REST against the 60 req/hr public cap. Enough for ~30–60 unique brew packages per hour; the lookup fails-open once exhausted.

### Edge cases

- **Fail-open.** If the age can't be determined (network down, missing `curl`/`jq`, third-party brew tap, malformed registry response), the update is shown anyway and a line lands in the debug log.
- **Brew signal.** The brew "publish date" is the formula file's commit time in `Homebrew/homebrew-core` or `homebrew-cask`, not the upstream project's release time. For homebrew-core that's typically within hours of upstream; for third-party taps the lookup fails-open.

## Subcommands

```sh
zsh-pkg-update-nag --now         # run the check immediately
zsh-pkg-update-nag --check-env   # show detected managers, config, and next-check time
zsh-pkg-update-nag --help
```

Tab-completion ships as `_zsh-pkg-update-nag`. oh-my-zsh picks it up automatically; standalone users may need to run `compinit` (or open a fresh shell) once after installing.

## Troubleshooting

The check is skipped on purpose in any of these cases:

- Non-interactive shells (scripts, here-docs).
- Dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`), non-TTY stdin/stdout, `INSIDE_EMACS` set.
- `CI` environment variable set.
- SSH sessions, unless `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_SSH=1`.
- Within the rate-limit window.
- Another shell is mid-check (file-lock held).

If you expect a check and it's not running:

```sh
ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_FORCE=1 zsh-pkg-update-nag --now    # bypass the rate-limit
zsh-pkg-update-nag --check-env                         # confirm detection
ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_DEBUG=1 zsh-pkg-update-nag --now    # write diagnostics
cat "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/zsh-pkg-update-nag/debug.log"
```

## Uninstall

Remove the plugin from your manager, then optionally wipe its state and config:

```sh
# oh-my-zsh
rm -rf "${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-pkg-update-nag"
# remove `zsh-pkg-update-nag` from the plugins=(...) array in ~/.zshrc

# zinit
# remove `zinit light madisonrickert/zsh-pkg-update-nag` from ~/.zshrc

# antidote
# remove `madisonrickert/zsh-pkg-update-nag` from ~/.zsh_plugins.txt

# zdot
# remove `zdot_load_module update-nag` from your .zshrc

# standalone
rm -rf ~/.zsh-pkg-update-nag
# remove the `source` line from ~/.zshrc

# optional: wipe state + config
rm -rf "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/zsh-pkg-update-nag"
rm -rf "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/zsh-pkg-update-nag"
```

## Requirements

- **zsh 5.0 or newer.**
- **Optional, only as needed:**
  - `jq`: improves Homebrew version-delta display (without it, brew versions show as `?`); also required for any `min_age > 0` lookup.
  - `curl`: required for `min_age > 0` on brew/uv/gem. Ships at `/usr/bin/curl` on macOS and most Linux distros.
  - [`cargo-update`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-update): required for the cargo provider. Install once with `cargo install cargo-update`; without it the provider is a silent no-op. Version 20.0.0+ adds native min-age filtering via `--cooldown`, which this plugin forwards automatically when `zsh_pkg_update_nag_min_age[_cargo]` is set.
  - [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/): enables the GraphQL fast path for brew min-age (one API call covering every package). Strongly recommended if you set `min_age > 0` for brew. Alternatively, set `$GITHUB_TOKEN` and the same path runs via `curl`.
  - `timeout` / `gtimeout`: wraps each provider call with a 10-second timeout. On macOS, `gtimeout` ships in `coreutils` (`brew install coreutils`).

## Caveats

- **Brew results reflect your last `brew update`.** The plugin doesn't refresh brew's local index. Running `brew update` from a shell hook would add 5–30 s of network I/O to startup. Brew already auto-updates the index on `brew install` / `brew upgrade` (every `HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS`, default 24 h), so the list catches up the next time you upgrade anything. Run `brew update` manually if you suspect the cache is stale.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Tests use [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core):

```sh
brew install bats-core
bats tests/
```

The codebase is zsh-specific (not bash-portable). Conventions:

- Every function begins with `emulate -L zsh; setopt local_options` so user shell options can't alter behavior.
- Commands are invoked array-style (`local cmd=(brew upgrade "$pkg"); "${cmd[@]}"`), never `eval` on user-or-network-derived strings.
- Internal symbols are prefixed `_zpun_`; public env vars are `ZSH_PKG_UPDATE_NAG_*`.
- `shellcheck` output is noisy on zsh-specific syntax (`${(f)…}`, `$+functions[…]`); `zsh -n` is the authoritative parse check.
